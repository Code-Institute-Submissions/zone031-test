        <h2>Lasertag as a sport</h2>
            <p>
                Lasertag as a sport has been growing a lot in recent years and we keep adding new countries to the list of active participants
                at international tournaments. The best players in the game have been competing, in some cases, for decades and have thousands of 
                hours of practice put into the game. The gameplay itself has grown organically since the mid 90s with a lot of development of 
                various playstyles in different eras. Every lasertag player is unique and there is no given physical type which is considered
                optimal for the sport. At very top level lasertag does require very good physique as it is a very fast paced game, however, player
                intelligence is definitely the key factor which makes for a good competetive lasertag player. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At Zone031 you will see several players who are among the best in the world and have dedicated years of training to not only learn,
                but also figure out how to play the game. All new players are heavily encouraged to find their own playstyle, watch, adapt and change 
                things that better players do in order to further enhance the game and grow the sport. You will meet an array of different player types 
                as well as players with very different levels of experience.

        <h2>Game formats</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Team Competition</h3>
            <p>
                 Team Competition is a game format standardised to a three team game. This means that three teams play against each other at the same time. 
                Each team has their own base to defend while they try to crack the opposing teams' bases. Playing three teams at the same time gives
                the format a unique feel and dynamic and makes it a tactically very challenging game. The standard number of players per team is five, but 
                four player tournaments are not uncommon, six was the former standard and other numbers are possible as well though very rare. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Team Elimination</h3>
            <p>
                Team Elimation is typically played with four teams but can be played with any number of teams with any number of team members. Players start
                with what is usually 10 lives and need to conserve these whilst scoring points and shooting away lives from opponents. If a player loses all 
                their lives they are eliminated from the game and their score is reduced to 0 points. So do not lose all of your lives!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Baserun</h3>
            <p>
                Baserun is a fast-paced format played three players in two teams on a neutral base. The target of the game is as usual to outscore the other 
                teams. In baserun it is very rare to see a team win against another team by not scoring more bases. This format is very intense in terms of 
                movement and positioning (and respositioning) and is usually well liked by new players. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Solos, doubles and triples</h3>
            <p>
                The number of different types of games in lasertag are virtually endless. Various game formats of baserun, elimination, open scoring, and more
                are usually played as side events at major tournaments.

    <section class="rules">
        <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The complete rules span a lot of pages and really only makes complete sense for experienced players. 
            The following are a simplification of the rules to allow inexperienced players a rough guide and the curious
            a general idea of how competetive lasertag is played.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>No Running</h4>
                <p>
                    You are not allowed to move with speed which exceeds your own control. As lasertag is played
                    in a dark arena with a lot of walls it is unsafe to move at really high speeds as you may easily
                    crash into other players, risking injury to both them and yourself. Players must at all times maintain
                    a speed at which they are able to stop with no more than one step.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>No Jumping</h4>
                <p>
                    You are not allowed to jump either as a way of avoiding shots or reaching over high walls. This is again for everybody's 
                    safety as you are not in complete control as you are in the air and easily may obstruct other players from moving freely.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>No Intentional Covering</h4>
                <p>
                    You are not allowed to use your arms, any other part of your body or any clothing or other things to cover part of your pack.
                    In order for lasertag to be a competetive sport, the packs need to be hitable while they are in play. It just makes the game
                    more fun and interesting that way.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>Give Way to Active Players</h4>
                <p>
                    Lasertag is a very active sport but players can either be active or inactive depending on the status of one's pack. As you are
                    waiting to be reactivated you need to make sure that you do not hinder an active player from progressing in the arena. Your time
                    as an inactive player is best spent looking for a strong position to respawn.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h4>No Climbing or Otherwise Improper Use of Arena</h4>
                <p>
                    Do not climb on walls or boxes. Lasertag is played on the ground. Also do not pull at walls or misuse the arena in any other
                    obvious way. 
                </p>
