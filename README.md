# Zone031

Zone031 is a laser tag club that I am long-standing member and current president of. For a long while we have lacked
a proper webpage and have been relying on facebook and other tools to handle our activities. Whilst this page won't 
be able to take over all of the functionalities we have on other pages (also active social media pages are important
for presence and maximising exposure) this page is intended to serve as a new front for the club which we will be able
to control the content and form of. 

## UX

The page is meant to primarily display what the club is about, what we do and how to get in contact with us. It is 
particularly important to give an immediate impression which is enticing as well as informative. We want people who
have heard of us or who are independently exploring how to play laser tag in a structured and competitive manner to
get a good impression of what it is that we do and how we do. We also want to have a page which is useful for our
international connections, providing them with information about our tournaments and showcasing our media accounts.

What this boils down to is two generalised target users in order of priority:
* The curious local: someone with little to no knowledge of who we are and what we do but with an interest to find out 
what we and the sport are about. 
* The experienced international: someone with previous lasertag experience who is looking to connect with us or stay informed
about our activities. 

### The curious local

The curious local will be met by an immediate welcome section (top left in desktpo and top on mobile) giving a short explanation
of what we are with links to our three active social media accounts (facebook, twitch and instagram). The text itself 
is written half as information and half as an advert to try to get people to try out lasertag, prompting them to scroll down
and fill out the form below. There is a carousel of images from inside of the arena and a training video give those who are 
curious a quick idea of how things are at our trainnig sessions.

There is further information about how the game functions in the section titled The Game. Most people won't read through all
of this, but the headlines should give a good overview and the content itself should exhaust the idea of different game formats
and the rules without being far too much and also not far too simplified. Media page showcases examples from our different kinds
of videos on different platforms as well as an interactive 3d overview of the arena we play at, giving a more in depth and closer
experience of our training sessions. In the About Us section the current committee is presented with relevant contact information
to allow the curious local a way of connecting with us.
